#####Step1:
#####Install scClustViz so that you can visualize your data.
#####If you already have devtools installed you can skip the first line and only install scClustViz.
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("BaderLab/scClustViz")

#####Step2:
#####First thing you need to do is download the package source file here:
#https://www.dropbox.com/s/dzgajhodp0m9r96/MouseSciaticNerve_0.1.0.tar.gz?dl=1

#####Step3:
#####Change the working directory to where you downloaded the file. You can go Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory and then choose the
#####appropriate directory

#####Step4:
#####Install the MouseSciaticNerve data package from the source file you downloaded.
install.packages("MouseSciaticNerve_0.1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")

#####Step5:
#####Load the MouseSciaticNerve package
library(MouseSciaticNerve)

#####Step6:
#####View the individual data sets in the Package
#####You can change the "Inj9dBeads" to any one of "Inj9dBeads", "Inj9dBeadsMesenchymal", "Inj9dFACS", "InjCombined", "InjUninjMesenchymalCombined", "UninjMesenchymal"
#####to see the different data sets.
viewMouseSciaticNerve("Inj9dBeads")

#####Step7:
#####Have a look through the different data sets and see if you're happy with how everything looks
#####if there is nothing to change. I will push this to a private repository on Github and then
#####make it public when the paper goes on-line.
#####Once the repository is public. Anyone will be able to install using the following commands:

# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("BaderLab/scClustViz")
# devtools::install_github("millerkaplanlab/MouseSciaticNerve")
